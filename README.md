Implementing an OV7670 CMOS camera module with DE10-Standard FPGA

This project is based off of Mike Field's VHDL design using OV7670 camera module which was then
implemented in the altera system using the mentioned source below to a DE2-115 fpga. 
I changed the pin layout to work with the Altera DE10-Standard SOC FPGA. This was done
for educational purposes only. Please refer to the sourced linked below for more information.
